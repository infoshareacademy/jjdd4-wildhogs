			"description": "So let’s start with the basics. Grab several large russet potatoes – I ended up using four large potatoes. Peel the skin from the potatoes using a potato peeler, then wash any dirt from the peeled potatoes. Once the potatoes have been peeled and rinsed, dice them into large chunks. Place all of the chunks of potato into a two quart or larger slow cooker OR place into a large sauce pan on the stove. Whether you choose to slow cook these potatoes or cook them on the stove top, be sure to cover the potatoes with water. If you’re slow cooking the potatoes, place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high four hours or low six hours. If you’re cooking the potatoes on the stove top, turn the heat to medium high heat and bring to a boil. Boil the potatoes for about ten minutes or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork. Once the cooking time is complete, remove the potatoes from the heat and pour off all of the water using a colander. Place the potatoes into a large mixing bowl and start mashing them with a potato masher. You don’t have to just pulverize the potatoes but you need to make sure there are no large chunks. Now it’s time to add the good stuff. Add in half of a cup of mayonnaise and half of a cup of mustard. Once the mayonnaise and mustard has been added to the potatoes, stir well until all ingredients are well combined.  Add in half of a teaspoon of ground black pepper one fourth of a teaspoon of salt, and then one teaspoon of granulated white sugar. Lastly, add in half of a cup of sweet pickle relish. This sweet pickle relish is what gives this Mustard Potato Salad such a good flavor!  Stir the sweet pickle relish into the Mustard Potato Salad and ensure that all ingredients are well combined. Once you’ve stirred in the sweet pickle relish, this Mustard Potato Salad is ready to serve! So just like that, you have easy, delicious, Mustard Potato Salad. Such a great addition to the dinner table!",

			"description": "Finely mince 3 large (or 4 medium) cloves of garlic and set aside, the finer the mince the better. Finely chop a few sprigs of fresh parsley set aside. De-vein, de-shell all raw shrimp and place on a plate with a layer of paper towels underneath and pat dry the top with another paper towel to remove all excess moisture. Season shrimp with a little salt and pepper (sea salt and fresh cracked multi colored pepper corns is my favorite) Cooking: Add 1 quarter of a stick of butter and a splash of olive oil (about a table spoon) to a large sauté pan (you should be able to add all of the shrimp at once without having any shrimp on top another). Turn heat up high and let butter melt (its important to bring the heat up fast and high but WITHOUT reaching the olive oils smoking point) and add shrimp to pan, cook on medium high heat for 2 minutes before disturbing the shrimp to get a nice sear. Once shrimp has gone from the grayish color to mostly pink flip the shrimp and sauté the other side for 2 minutes. Remove shrimp and place into a dish with low sides to contain the butter garlic sauce (a small casserole dish works well). Add 3 quarters of a stick of butter and finely minced garlic to sauté pan with heat on medium (the one you cooked the shrimp in). Allow the butter to melt completely and poor over shrimp, sprinkle fresh chopped parsley and a splash of lemon juice over the shrimp and serve. If you are adding to pasta, Remove the tails when de-shelling, and add in a little heavy cream and fresh grated parmesian cheese during the last step (making the sauce in the pan after removing the shrimp) for a creamy garlic butter sauce, goes great with angel hair pasta or linguini.",

			"description": "Shakshuka is a North African dish that is now made throughout the Middle East; it is especially popular in Israel, where it is often eaten for breakfast. I usually find myself serving it with a side salad as a light evening meal. It’s super easy and versatile. When my hubby was in the Israeli army, he and the other soldiers would sneak into the barracks kitchen late at night and cook shakshuka using whatever they could find in the pantries. It’s a vegetarian one-skillet meal that is easy to make, very healthy, and totally addicting. Heat a deep, large skillet or sauté pan on medium. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, sauté for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to sauté till mixture is fragrant. Add the diced bell pepper, sauté for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened. Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir until blended. Add spices and sugar, stir, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne... it is extremely spicy!). Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook over easy style on top of the tomato sauce. Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too much, which can lead to burning. Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste. Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if you are gluten-intolerant or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal.",

			"description": "Pillowy soft sugar cookies topped with buttercream and colorful sprinkles, just like the ones from the grocery store bakery, but made even better in your own kitchen. Place the softened butter and granulated sugar into a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 1 minute, or until pale and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low, and add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the bowl. Beat the mixture for about 1 minute, until all ingredients are combined. Shape the cookie dough into three portions. Flatten into rough circles approximately 1” thick and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the cookie dough for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 150° C. Remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator. Generously dust a clean work surface with flour. Unwrap one portion of cookie dough. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough to ½ thickness. Using a 3” round cookie cutter, cut the cookie dough into circles, and transfer onto the prepared baking sheets. Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining 2 portions of cookie dough. Transfer the baking sheets to the preheated oven. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes, until puffy and slightly golden brown at the edges. Remove the baking sheets from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the sheets, then transfer them to cooling racks to cool completely before frosting and decorating. While the cookies cool, make the frosting. Using either a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, cream together the butter and cream cheese until smooth. With the mixer on the lowest speed, add half of the powdered sugar. Mix until combined, then add the remaining powdered sugar, vanilla, heavy cream, salt, and desired food coloring to the bowl. Beat on high speed for 2-3 minutes, until the frosting is light and fluffy. Once the cookies are completely cool, spread each with 1-2 Tbs. of buttercream. Top with sprinkles, if desired. Store cookies in the refrigerator. For best flavor and texture, allow the cookies to sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes before eating.",

			"description": "A proper English breakfast usually starts with a big pile of meats. Bacon and various sausages are almost always included. For the frittata version, we want these things, but we don’t need as much. A small amount of each will give us the flavor we need in our English Breakfast Frittata. You’ll also want some tomatoes and mushrooms. I went with cherry tomatoes rather than using whole tomatoes because they would bake into the frittata easier. While you don’t need a cast iron skillet for this dish, it’s makes it dumb simple to make. If you have a 12-inch variety, you can cook your fillings in the pan and then add the eggs and bake the whole thing in the same pan. Start by adding your sausage and bacon to the skillet over medium heat. Add the meats to a cold skillet so they heat slowly and some of the fat renders out. Let them cook for 10-12 minutes until they are nicely browned. Then you can remove the sausage and bacon and add the sliced mushrooms and tomatoes. When the mushrooms start to wither and lose their liquid, you can also add the black beans. These veggies will just need to cook for 4-5 minutes. Don’t over-cook the beans or they will get mushy. While you could just scramble some eggs and toss them in the pan, I wanted to bulk up the eggs a bit to make them richer so I whisked in some Greek yogurt. You will need to whisk this so the yogurt gets fully incorporated! Then add the bacon and sausage back to the skillet and pour in the eggs! Now would be a good time to season with a pinch of salt and pepper as well. Once the eggs are added, return it to the stove for about 30 seconds to start cooking the eggs and then it’s ready for the oven. If you have a cast iron skillet, just transfer the whole thing to the oven and let it bake for about 15 minutes until the eggs are set in the center. If you don’t have a cast iron skillet, you’ll have to transfer your fillings to an 8×8 baking dish and then pour the eggs in and bake that. It’ll need a few extra minutes to bake, but should work fine. This was my finished English Breakfast Frittata! Fresh chives are a great garnish for a little onion flavor and also color. While I normally would add cheese to a frittata, I didn’t miss it with all the other stuff that’s going on in this English Breakfast Frittata.",
